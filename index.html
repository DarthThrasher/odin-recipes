    <h1>Abuela's Picadillo</h1>

        <h2>Picadillo Plate</h2>
        <p>This is my grandmother's Cuban picadillo (ground beef hash/chili) recipe which is usually served with white rice, <br> 
        beans and plantains. Picadillo also goes great with mashed potatoes and can be made without the squash. <br> 
        This dish is a favorite at home so I usually make 2 pounds to have leftovers for making empanadas (meat pies) the next day. <br> 
        Picadillo also freezes well. Of course my kids say this is the best picadillo they've ever had and I have to agree!</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Heat olive oil in small skillet over medium heat. Add onion, green bell pepper, and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir into beef in the stockpot.</li>
